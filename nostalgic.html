        <h2>Nostagic Movies</h2>
        <p>Movies from 1960s-2000s</p>
    <article>
        <h3>GoodFellas</h3>
        <img src="images/goodFellasPoster.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Masterfully balances drama and comedy while giving a brutally honest account of life in the mob. A certified Scorsese classic</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Fargo</h3>
        <img src="images/fargoPoster.jpg" alt="">
        <p>A darkly hilarious movie with a soul. Stellar cast, writing, and music. One of my favorites.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Event Horizon</h3>
        <img src="images/eventHorizonPoster.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This is a really goofy film. It has interesting, gory visuals and takes an unusual turn with the sci-fi genre. It's just that this film is also so 90's that it hurts.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>The Blob (1988)</h3>
        <img src="images/blobPoster.jpg" alt="">
        <p>It's a cheesey creature feature with disgustingly stunning practical effects. If you have the stomach for it, it's a fun ride.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>The Terminator 2</h3>
        <img src="images/t2judgementDayPoster.jpg" alt="">
        <p>While not as scary as the first, this movie is an improvement over its predecessor in almost every way. The action is iconic, but this movie is surprisingly at its best during its quiet, thoughtful moments.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>The Terminator</h3>
        <img src="images/theTerminatorPoster.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Its strength is its simplicity. It's not about time travel. It's about a cold, unstoppable, single-minded killer who has it out for you.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</h3>
        <img src="images/montyPythonPoster.jpg" alt="">
        <p>A prime example of what a great cast can do with a small budget. It's unabashedly absurdist, infinitely quotable, and endlessly rewatchable.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Eraserhead</h3>
        <img src="images/eraserheadPoster.jpg" alt="">
        <p>It's not so much of a story as it is an experience. Bizarre and creepy, I've rarely felt so uncomfortable watching a film. I love it.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Last Hurrah for Chivalry</h3>
        <img src="images/lastHurrahPoster.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Clever action and surprising suspense. The interaction between Tsing and Chan is a treat, and I wish there was even more of it.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Phantasm</h3>
        <img src="images/phantasmPoster.jpg" alt="">
        <p>It's a creative for sure. It makes the best out of its low budget, and it's fun for just how weird it is. There just isn't much of a story</p>
